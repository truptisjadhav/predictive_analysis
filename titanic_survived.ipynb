    "## The challenge\n",

    "We want you to use the Titanic passenger data (name, age, price of ticket, etc) to try to predict who will survive and who will die.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The data\n",
    "\n",
    "To take a look at the competition data, click on the **<a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Data tab</b></a>** at the top of the competition page.  Then, scroll down to find the list of files.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two files in the data: (1) **train.csv**, (2) **test.csv** \n",
    "\n",
    "### (1) train.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "**train.csv** contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 passengers, to be exact -- where each passenger gets a different row in the table).  To investigate this data, click on the name of the file under the **\"Data Sources\"** column (on the left of the screen).  Once you've done this, all of the column names (along with a brief description of what they contain) are listed to the right of the screen, under the **\"Columns\"** heading.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The values in the second column (**\"Survived\"**) can be used to determine whether each passenger survived or not: \n",
    "- if it's a \"1\", the passenger survived.\n",
    "- if it's a \"0\", the passenger died.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the first passenger listed in **train.csv** is Mr. Owen Harris Braund.  He was 22 years old when he died on the Titanic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (2) test.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the patterns you find in **train.csv**, you have to predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (in **test.csv**) survived.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Click on **test.csv** (under the **\"Data Sources\"** column) to examine its contents.  Note that **test.csv** does not have a **\"Survived\"** column - this information is hidden from you, and how well you do at predicting these hidden values will determine how highly you score in the competition!
